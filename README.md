# Python-AP-CHALLENGE
Module 5
For this challenge I had to utilize my knowledge gained within this week to make graphs, using linear equations and r-value I also had to discuss relationships between the equations.

I had to over the classes and make some notes as a refresher, I also had a few calls during this wk with BCS they were very helpful. Discussing the relationship was kind of hard that I had to do some research but I managed to finish it.
