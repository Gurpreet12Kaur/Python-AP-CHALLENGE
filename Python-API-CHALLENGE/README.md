# Python-AP-CHALLENGE
Module 5:
The true power of data, to me, lies in its ability to definitively answer questions. With the knowledge I've gained about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals, I am excited to utilize this valuable insight to address a fundamental question that intrigues me personally: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

For this module challenge, I had to go over the class recording and watch some youtube videos, I also had a few calls with ASK BCS, for one of them my map wasn't showing and they helped me by modifying my code, therefore, I was able to change it.
